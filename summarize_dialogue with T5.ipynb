    "# Generative AI Use Case: Summarize Dialogue using FLAN-T5 \n",
    "\n",
    " you will do the dialogue summarization task using generative AI. You will explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task you need. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, you will take the first step towards prompt engineering and see how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models."

    "<h1>Instruction tuning</h1>\n",
    "Instruction tuning is a technique that involves fine-tuning a language model on a collection of NLP tasks using instructions. In this technique, the model is trained to perform tasks by following textual instructions instead of specific datasets for each task. The model is fine-tuned with a set of input and output examples for each task, allowing the model to generalize to new tasks that it hasn’t been explicitly trained on as long as prompts are provided for the tasks. Instruction tuning helps improve the accuracy and effectiveness of models and is helpful in situations where large datasets aren’t available for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A myriad of instruction tuning research has been performed since 2020, producing a collection of various tasks, templates, and methods. One of the most prominent instruction tuning methods, Finetuning language models (Flan), aggregates these publicly available collections into a Flan Collection to produce fine-tuned models on a wide variety of instructions. In this way, the multi-task Flan models are competitive with the same models independently fine-tuned on each specific task and can generalize beyond the specific instructions seen during training to following instructions in general."

    "<h1>Zero-shot learning</h1>\n",
    "Zero-shot learning in NLP allows a pre-trained LLM to generate responses to tasks that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. In this technique, the model is provided with an input text and a prompt that describes the expected output from the model in natural language. The pre-trained models can use its knowledge to generate coherent and relevant responses even for prompts it hasn’t specifically been trained on. Zero-shot learning can reduce the time and data required while improving efficiency and accuracy of NLP tasks. Zero-shot learning is used in a variety of NLP tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and text generation."

    "Few-shot learning involves training a model to perform new tasks by providing only a few examples. This is useful where limited labeled data is available for training. Although this post primarily focuses on zero-shot learning, the referenced models are also capable of generating responses to few-shot learning prompts."

    "<h1>Flan-T5 model</h1>\n",
    "A popular encoder-decoder model known as T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is one such model that was subsequently fine-tuned via the Flan method to produce the Flan-T5 family of models. Flan-T5 is an instruction-tuned model and therefore is capable of performing various zero-shot NLP tasks, as well as few-shot in-context learning tasks. With appropriate prompting, it can perform zero-shot NLP tasks such as text summarization, common sense reasoning, natural language inference, question answering, sentence and sentiment classification, translation, and pronoun resolution."
